Throughout this trimester I mainly focused on the frontend and design of the websites. I worked mainly using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for most of our pages, creating the design on the front page(index), login, upload, calender, register, navbar, and resources page. For most of these pages I attempted to use the same image background of an isometric 3d model, and when I could not I used a slight gradient with the same colors in order to maintain the same aesthetic. For the navbar I also tried to keep a simplistic design with similar colors to the background. I also tried to a little work in trying to create databases in order to get the upload working by creating an upload class in model.py, creating content.py, and adding the required components in __init__.py. However, most of the python coding and database work was completed by Kurtis.
