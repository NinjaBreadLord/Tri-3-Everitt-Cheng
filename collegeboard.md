## Create Task
Idea: Create a list of numbers incrementing by 1 with the length based on user input. Randomly choose a number in this list and have the user guess until he gets the number. If the user guesses higher it prints that it is too high, and if it is too low it prints it is too low. Eventually the user should reach the number and then it should out put number of guesses afterwards.
